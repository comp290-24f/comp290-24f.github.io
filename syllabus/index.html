        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Term:</strong> Fall 2024</p>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Instructors</strong>: Ajay Gandecha (agandecha@unc.edu) and Noah Smith (nsmith2@unc.edu)
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Section</strong>: In-Person W 2:30p to 3:45p in Fred Brooks Building FB009.</p>

        <p class="md-typescale-headline-small font-semibold mt-4">Course Description, Target Audience, and Prerequisites
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">This course introduces students to essential computer science tools and technologies not taught
            in other classes. Students will also learn methodologies to help them plan, develop, and present their own
            software projects. By the end of this course, students will expand their computer science toolbelt, gain
            experience with tools used extensively in industry, and be well-prepared for taking upper-division computer
            science classes and begin working on their own extracurricular projects.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">The target audience for this course are Undergraduate Computer Science majors, or prospective
            Computer Science majors, who either are currently enrolled in COMP 210, or COMP 211 / 301. Students past
            COMP and COMP 301 are better served enrolling in <em>COMP 423: Foundations of Software Engineering</em>
            instead. </p>
        <p class="mt-2"><strong>Prerequisite(s)</strong>: Previously enrolled, or placed out of, COMP 110; Pre- or
            corequisite, COMP 210.</p>
        <!-- Goals -->
        <p class="md-typescale-headline-small font-semibold mt-4">Goals</p>
        <p class="mt-2">The goal of this course is to teach students about essential tools for the computer scientist
            toolkit, including but not limited to:</p>
        <ul> <!-- NOTE! The bulletpoints appear to be bugged. -->
            <li class="mt-2">1. Introduce students to essential software engineering tools commonly used in both UNC
                Computer Science
                classes and in industry, such as the shell and command-line interface, git, GitHub, containerization
                with Docker, basics on HTTP servers and APIs, deploying to the web, vim, generative AI tools, and more.
            </li>
            <li class="mt-2">2. Teach students one the most vital skill for any computer scientist - learning effective
                strategies for
                self-learning through reading documentation and research.</li>
            <li class="mt-2">3. Teach students how to create software side-projects, research and learn new technologies
                needed to
                complete side projects, give students the opportunity to experiment with the programming language of
                their choice, and present their projects in a visually appealing and informative way on GitHub.</li>
            <li class="mt-2">4. Expose students to the undergraduate UNC Computer Science community, showcase student
                organizations, and
                survey some higher-level elective courses.</li>
        </ul>
        <!-- Course Modality and Attendance Policy -->
        <p class="md-typescale-headline-small font-semibold mt-4">Course Modality and Attendance Policy</p>
        <p class="mt-2">This course will meet <strong>in-person</strong> every Wednesday from 2:30pm-3:45pm in FB009.
            Attendance is
            <strong>required</strong> and will make up a decent part of your final grade.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">During lecture, you will be able to critically engage in the material, ask questions, talk to
            your peers, and
            make friends in the UNC Computer Science community. This course is designed to be interactive, and studentsâ€™
            participation and interaction with the course and their classmates is the <em>most valuable asset</em> of
            this
            course! We only meet once a week, a total of 15 meetings in the semester, so we plan on making each meeting
            count. If you do not plan on attending class regularly, we recommend you opt for a different course.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-2">To account for unexpected situations, such as illness or otherwise, each student is permitted to
            be absent
            for <em>one (1) lecture meeting without any penalty, prior approval, or instructor notification</em>,
            regardless of
            absence type (university approved or otherwise). After one missed lecture, absences will count against your
            in-class activities and participation grade unless they are university or instructor approved.

            <p class="mt-2">This course will have a final project, which will consist of developing a plan to create an
                extracurricular software side project of your choice. By the end of the project, you will learn about
                how to
                develop software project ideas, research new technologies, read documentation, and develop a timeline to
                make meaningful progress on such ideas. In addition, you will have a real, tangible plan for creating a

            </p>
            <p>Assignments with 5:00am deadlines will have <strong>late periods open for 72 hours</strong>. If an

                is submitted
                late, a <strong>15% penalty</strong> will be applied to the submission. Submissions cannot be made

        <p class="mt-2">All students are expected to follow the guidelines of the UNC Honor Code. Students may use
            artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT to reinforce or explain concepts, but never to complete
            assignments, generate code to submit on assignments, or generate text to submit for assignments -
            <strong>especially</strong>
            on the final project submission. Doing so is an Honor Court violation and will result in a 0 on that portion
            of an assignment. For programming assignment submissions, you must understand and be able to explain any
            code snippet, derivation, or generated code you make use of in your work if asked by an instructor.
        </p>
        <p>Collaboration may be permitted on some assignments: if so, it will be clearly listed on the assignment
            itself. When collaborating with others, make sure to write the full name of the peers you are collaborating
            with.</p>
